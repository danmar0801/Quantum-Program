## Project Title: 
Shor's Algorithm for Integer Factorization Using Qiskit

## Project Description: 
Implemented Shor's algorithm for integer factorization using Qiskit, a quantum computing software development kit developed by IBM. The algorithm involves finding the period of a function using a quantum circuit, which can be used to factorize large composite numbers into their prime factors. The project required a strong understanding of quantum algorithms and mathematics.

## Key Skills: 
Quantum Computing, Qiskit, Shor's Algorithm, Integer Factorization, Quantum Circuits, Mathematics

## Results: 
Successfully implemented the algorithm to factorize the integer 108976 into its prime factors. This project demonstrated an understanding of quantum algorithms and mathematics and provided hands-on experience with Qiskit, a widely used quantum computing software development kit.

## Additional Information: 
This project was completed as part of a [CS3650: Computer Architucture], and was a valuable learning experience in quantum computing. I am passionate about exploring the potential of quantum computing and am excited to continue learning and working in this field.
